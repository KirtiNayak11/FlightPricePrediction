<h2 align="center">Flight Price Prediction using Machine Learning</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This project develops a machine learning model to predict flight prices. This helps travelers make informed decisions and airlines optimize their pricing strategies.The model is built on a flight booking dataset obtained from the "EaseMyTrip" website. EaseMyTrip is an internet platform for booking flight tickets, commonly used by potential passengers. By analyzing this data, the model will aid in the discovery of valuable insights that benefit both travelers and airlines.</p>
